<h2>Our History</h2>
<img src="girl.png" alt="felicity belmont">
<p><b>Second</b> Chances Rescue was founded in 2015 by Felicity Belmont, a former veterinary technician and lifelong animal advocate. After relocating from Denver to the quiet town of Chicago, New Mexico, Felicity was heartbroken by the number of stray and mistreated animals she encountered in the rural areas surrounding her new home. With just a small barn, a few kennels, and a deep belief that every creature deserves another chance, she began taking in animals in need one rescue at a time.</p>
<p>Word spread quickly, and within a year, Felicity had gathered a group of dedicated volunteers and secured nonprofit status. Today, Second Chances Rescue has grown into a trusted community shelter and adoption center, having saved and rehomed over 2,000 animals. Felicityâ€™s efforts continue to inspire our team and guide our mission every day.
